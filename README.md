## Description about this poject

 In our city library, the process of borrowing books and managing transactions is outdated and inefficient. Borrowers must pay for their borrowings in cash, and the library tracks users, books, borrowings, and payments manually on paper. This traditional system presents several challenges:

- No way to check the availability of specific books in real-time.
- Limited payment options, restricted to cash only.
- Inability to easily track who returned books on time and who did not.
- Inefficient and time-consuming manual record-keeping.

This project aims to address these issues by implementing an online library management system for book borrowings.
